Hello fellow user of our Contriboard service!  
  
We are sorry to announce that we are going to shut down the Contriboard as a free service!  
We would like to thank you all for your presence in our service.   
  
If you want to save your current data you should login in the Contriboard service during   
12.6.2017-17.6.2017 and make a copy if needed.  
  
We will remove all data and shutdown service 18.6.2017 at 14:00 EET   
  
All data will be destroyed after shutdown and there is no need for further actions by you.  
  
Contriboard service was a example of lean startup experiment by N4S@JAMK team. You will find us from http://jamk.fi/en   
Contriboard service was developed during DIMECC's Strategic Research Program called N4S (Need for Speed) during 2014-2016.
